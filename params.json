You can freely install, use and distribute it as a standalone application or as a web application to use it from every internet access and media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nDolibarr is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version (GPL-3+).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## INSTALL\r\n\r\nIf you have no technical knowledge, and you are looking for an autoinstaller to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in few clicks, you must download DoliWamp (the all-in-one package of Dolibarr for Windows), DoliDeb (the all-in-one package of Dolibarr for Debian or Ubuntu) or DoliRpm (the all-in-one package of Dolibarr for Fedora, Redhat, Opensue, Mandriva or Mageia).\r\n\r\nYou can download this at: [Official website] (http://www.dolibarr.org/downloads/)\r\n\r\nIf you already have installed a Web server and a Mysql database, you can install the standard version like this:\r\n\r\n- Uncompress the downloaded archive.\r\n\r\n- Copy directory \"dolibarr\" and all its files inside your web server root, or copy directory anywhere and set up your web server to use \"dolibarr/htdocs\" as root for a new web server virtual host (second choice need to be server administrator).\r\n  \r\n- Create an empty file \"htdocs/conf/conf.php\" and set permissions for your web server user (write permissions will be removed once install is finished).\r\n  \r\n- From your browser, call the dolibarr \"install/\" page.\r\n\r\nUrl depends on choice made on first step:\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/\r\nor\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost/dolibarr/install/\r\nor\r\n\r\n\thttp://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/\r\n   \r\n- Follow instructions provided by installer...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## UPGRADE\r\n\r\nTo upgrade Dolibarr from an old version to this one:\r\n\r\n- Overwrite all old files inside old 'dolibarr' directory by files provided into new version package.\r\n  \r\n- If you came from version x.y.z to x.y.w (only third number differ), there is no need to run any migrate process.\r\n  \r\n- If you came from a beta version or from any version x.y.z to any other where x or y number differs, you must call the Dolibarr \"install/\" page in your browser (this should be done automatically at first dolibarr access).\r\n\r\nThis URL should looks like:\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/\r\nor\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost/dolibarr/install/\r\nor\r\n\r\n\thttp://yourdolibarrhost/install/\r\n\r\nThen choose the \"update\" option according to your case.\r\nNote: Migrate process can be ran safely several times.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n## WHAT'S NEW\r\n\r\nSee ChangeLog file found into package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## WHAT DOLIBARR CAN DO\r\n\r\n### Main modules/features:\r\n\r\n- Customers, Prospects or Suppliers directory\r\n- Products and services catalog\r\n- Stock management\r\n- Bank accounts management\r\n- Orders management with PDF export\r\n- Commercial proposals management\r\n- Contracts management\r\n- Invoices management\r\n- Payments management\r\n- Standing orders management\r\n- Shipping management\r\n- Agenda with ical,vcal export for third tools integration\r\n- ECM (Electronic Content Management)\r\n- Foundations members management\r\n- Employee's holidays management\r\n- Mass emailing\r\n- Realize surveys\r\n- Point of Sale\r\n\r\n### Other modules:\r\n\r\n- Bookmarks management\r\n- Donations management\r\n- Reporting\r\n- Data export/import tools\r\n- LDAP connectivity\r\n- Third parties or products categories \r\n- ClickToDial phone numbers\r\n- RSS integration\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous:\r\n\r\n- Multi-user, with several permissions levels for each feature.\r\n- Serveral menu managers (can be used by internal users, as a back-office, with a particular menu, or by external users, as a front-office, with another menu and permissions).\r\n- Very user friendly and easy to use.\r\n- Optional WYSIWYG forms, optional Ajax forms.\r\n- Several skins.\r\n- Code is highly customizable (a lot of use of modules and submodules).\r\n- Works with Mysql 4.1 or higher, or PostgreSql 8.14 or higher.\r\n- Works with PHP 5.0 or higher.\r\n- An easy to understand and maintain code (PHP with no heavy frameworks).\r\n- A trigger architecture to allow you to make Dolibarr business events run PHP code to update your own information system.\r\n- \"NPR VAT Rate\" (French particularity for managing VAT in DOM-TOM called \"Non Perçue Récupérable\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## WHAT DOLIBARR CAN'T DO YET (TODO LIST)\r\n\r\nThis is features that Dolibarr does not support completely yet:\r\n\r\n- No double party accountancy (only bank management).\r\n- Dolibarr manage one currency at once (mono-currency).\r\n- Dolibarr manage one master company/foundation (mono-company).
